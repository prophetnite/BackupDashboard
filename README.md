# BackupDashboard
Small Dashboard to monitor backup systems<br>

Only setup required is to add your API key to ../config.php<br>
The config.php file must be one level below your main Dashboard, this is only so I dont let my keys out on accident. :D<br><br>
Current support is only for Datto Appliances using your Datto XML API key and ShadowControl server for StorageCraft JSON feed.

<h5>Support Plan:</h5>
  Datto XML Feed</br>
  VaultLogix via host agent</br>
  StorageCraft via <strike>host agent, RPC, and DCOM</strike> ShadowControl server JSON feed</br>
  (Feel free to add support for your own)</br>
